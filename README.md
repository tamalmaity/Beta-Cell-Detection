# Beta-Cell-Detection
Diabetes has been linked with a reduction in the functional ÃŸ cell mass.
Thus, to cure it or to stop its progress, this cell mass must be restored.
A count of the cell mass of such kind requires determination of the number 
of nuclei in the insulin stained area. Such a count consumes a significant 
time if done by skilled personnels. Also, this count result might vary if 
carried out by different persons, hence, the results become subjective. 
In this project, we develop an approach based on the cascading of weak 
learners called decision stumps which are boosted in nature. The learners 
gather information from a provided dataset and form a series of layers which 
go on to analyse the coarser to the finer aspects of the cell image. This 
method gives significantly better experimental results when compared to the 
results produced by humans and excels previous reported results.
